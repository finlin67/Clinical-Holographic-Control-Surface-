# Clinical Holographic Control Surface

A high-performance, standalone React dashboard component constrained to a **600x600px** viewport. Designed with a dual-theme "Pulse Core" aesthetic, utilizing advanced Framer Motion path animations and SVG-based Sparklines.

## ✨ Final Audit Status

- **Dimensions**: Strict 600x600 container with flex-centering logic.
- **Code Quality**: Monolithic architecture for maximum portability. No external local dependencies.
- **Performance**: Memoized SVG components and throttled simulation loops.
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios in both Light/Dark modes.
- **Visuals**: Glassmorphism, 1080p-grade typography (Manrope), and custom scrollbars.

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is entry-pointed through `index.tsx` and requires the `Tailwind CSS` CDN (provided in `index.html`) to render the utility classes.
